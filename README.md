Coding Challenge Exercise for VEO

## Disclaimer
  While I had immensely enjoyed this exercise, it is **not** a fully completed feature and has many bugs, and is unfinished due to time constraints.

  In the challenge's specification, even, it was stated that the code "*doesn't have to be complete*", which I took on its face value. I had spent around 4 hours on it, although perhaps a little more - in that ballpark anyway.

  I would have loved to spend more time on this exercise to get rid of its technical debt, finish, and polish it into a nicer feature, which it deserves! :)

## Tech information
  - This project uses *NodeJS* for package management
  - This project uses **WebPack** for module bundling
  - This project uses **Babel** for transpiling
  - This project uses **ReactJS** width **TypeScript** for the frontend
  - This project uses **MaterialUI** for UI components
  - This project uses **ExpressJS** for the backend
  - The data on the backend is simply stored in a **JSON** file `hierarchy.json` at the root of the project
  
## Running the project
  1. Make sure you have `NodeJS` installed
  2. Navigate to your terminal
  3. Run `npm install` to install the **node_modules** directory
  4. Run `node server` in the root of the project's directory to start the backend **ExpressJS* server
  $. In a separate terminal tab/window run `npm run start` to start the **ReactJS* web app
  
 I look forward to seeing you and interviewing with you, and please let me know if you require any additional information from me! :)
